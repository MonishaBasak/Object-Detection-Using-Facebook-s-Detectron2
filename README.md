# Object-Detection-Using-Facebook-s-Detectron2
Detectron2 is a research platform and a production library for deep learning, built by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). We will be building an Object Detection Language Identification Model to identify English and Hindi texts written which can be extended to different use cases. We will look at the entire cycle of Model Development and Evaluation in Detectron2. We will first look at how to load a dataset, visualize it and prepare it as an input to the Deep Learning Model. 

We will then look at how we can build a Faster R-CNN model in Detectron2 and customize it. We will then configure the parameters & hyperparameters of the model. We will then move on to training the Model and subsequently to model inference and evaluation.
